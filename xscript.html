but think it's wonderful to be here
and it's great to see a lot of old friends and
up we learned a lot from my they are in school as well it's great to see a film
up bill and all the staff there I'll so I'm gonna
where live behind something to try to move quickly I I think quite a few
people aren't up to me with the concept of universal design I wanna
focus on Universal Design for Learning and
I wanna n with three things that are really quite promising
and one thing that I think I'm gonna try to enlist your help and
I but just to make sure we're all on the same
I'll starting point and discuss that with the concert universal design
I apologize lotsa people are pretty for me with that but here's a school used to
work with
I'm in Peabody here's the entrance to the school and
as you probably know that the stairs here are meant to be an access
technology a way to get in the building
I but in fact but but what if this turns we first worked with Matthew so if
you've
heard me talk about Matthew before met his very severe physical disability
and can't I walk talk point
a smile our Anne those things I
and he certainly can't get in this building cuz he's mobile an electric
wheelchair
which he drives with his chant and
he was the whatever first I
really challenging moto Rick Lee youngsters
and we hook them up gotta say could drive a wheelchair but then
came the problem of I entering the school building
and I
really now start the story quite differently than I used to because
there's really two ways to view the problem
one is to view the problem is Matthews problem that is Matthew
skinny has a disability we've got to somehow fix
a remediate Matthew the second way to be the problem
is to view it as the school's prop or the cultures problem that the school
is in fact disabled and not welcoming
to a student like Matthew artwork
recently thank you very much which has focused
on the latter view of things how do we help the disabilities
that schools have and I wanna say why we do that if you view the problem is
Matt's disability
then it limits the range up solutions you look for
and the wanna show you this is Matt is Joe
not mine I but Matthew suggestion for
what's the assistive technology that would have allowed him I
to go to school the
and I
the thing is that Matthew understood
that but he was very computer savvy drove his wheelchair and did all his
communications through computer
I and he know that inside this
big instrument was a computer and that
with the computer inside you could drive it the important thing is
that students with disabilities teach us something about the progression of
things we typically think there's one progression
from here to there and we think up that you first got to learn to toddle and
then a tricycle and then a bicycle and then a
a a 57 Chevy and so on
up but in fact those progressions aren't always
a true for everyone in fact Matthew
can't is never going to ride a tricycle or a bicycle or any those things he
doesn't
the those are things you can't do I but he knows that with this
powerful technology inside to this he can actually drive a train
came quite well so he did the research on and show the school how to get them
and so on
I but the school didn't do that
I there where prod the
you can imagine the cost $60 million dollars each she could only use it once
per building and so on
so
but the other way to view the problem is to view it as the school's disability
and then you look for a different set of solutions the for solutions
are typically how do we fix up the existing school how do we retrofit
numbers its a broken and disable now how do we make it better and we put ramps on
the site to buildings and so on
and it's very expensive it's ugly like this is
and often effect this ramp didn't work for Matix the corners were too sharp and
so on
just lotsa problems in trying to fix up things later after they've been built
so must be in know the a better solution is to move toward universal designs
build the building right at the beginning so everybody can use it
I'm showing here an image up the luv in Paris which has a
wonderful stare an elevator combo
on it looks like it's missing in the second picture here on the right but
it's really that that too goes up and down see control a wheelchair rental a
top and so on
that's really kinda cool so people have choices their alternatives built
into the universal design it's cheaper better faster
a more beautiful all the usual reasons
who benefits from Universal the sites I'm showing here a curb cut
and curb cuts a course originally word I'll sign for people
I'll up who were mobile in wheelchairs and so on
up but as you I know I that
particular piece up design benefits many people on I'm gonna go fast here
people in scooters people in baby carriages people are hauling their
so case from the airport and so on in addition to people who have
I motor disabilities so building
but now we like it that there are these subs cuts everywhere in the same is true
for captions on television it used to be that
it was something that individuals a disability had to buy a decoder box
to in fact get access to their television now there's a universal
design
law that says that all television sold in the United States need to have a
decoder chip in them
and as you know I it come with every TV you buy it now
many if you don't use your captions I now do actually is my caption Kazmi
hearing starting to fail
I but I also have trouble following dialogue on Grey's Anatomy and stuff cuz
they talk so fast
so no see that happen to learn to turn on the
turn on the captions for Grey's Anatomy on our and
a any other shows with a top s turn on the captions it helps a lot
I they made so there are many people who benefit from captions they're built and
they're available when we need them
I and you probably know this story but in fact users who are deaf or far down
the list to people who use captions
people in bars in airports an exercise facilities all these things I'm showing
here
are who actually really mostly is this captions and people like me
I and individuals who are deaf happened also benefits a universal designs are
about
building things and to the environment that make them better for all of us
including people with disabilities but not only people disabilities
now skip this design this side mostly what's better about universal design
we like it cuz it recognize the reality of diversity
universal designs are saying we need to put alternatives and it's not that
there's one way to be mobile in a building
I it's not one way to read signs and so on
a building in from the start means it's less costly it's more efficient its
more aesthetic benefits more people
at CAS we work on universes I'm for learning it's not about the building
it's not about the playground hopefully all those are universally designed
I'll but it's about how lists Matthew can actually learn
and I want to tell you a new end to this story matt is now in
money for community colleges here in this state and I'll
it turned out Matthew not only had a physical disability
but he turned out to have a learning disability when hit fourth-grade
he was not a good breeder an issue I think know lots of you
know these kinds of stories I that people think that having one disability
makes you immune to all the others
and I so it took a long time to discover that Matthew had a regular dyslexia
learning disability wasn't any big deal but took a long time to discover cuz
everybody
had low expectations because I miss physical disability
and you've all heard that story many times I'll
so in Matthew got ready to go to school I
this was the learning technology in his classroom and it didn't work for him
in several ways first he couldn't hold in the country in the pages
so I really could use it at all and it knows
early days we use to try to do things like page turning devices
some there are quite expensive don't work well and so on
and I'll a
the book doesn't also worked well for lots of other students including Matthew
because it can't read very well
I'll and up excuse me doesn't work also for students who are blind students who
are
I English language learners a long list a people known this learning technology
is not an ideal learning technology so our work with Matthew and then other
students
began us to reverse again the field
how do we look at this problem of learning technologies
and we first began to see it as Matthews problem Matthew needed fixing
needed remedial this or whatever it was sir fixing up him so he can turn pages
we begin though to see the problem the other way that this learning technology
had its own disabilities was not effective for a wide range of students
was made for an hour range of students
for home it was pretty good and I
we begin to see our work as taking their how do we design better learning
technologies
out of that work and not I don't mean to brag about this but this one I'm
highlight something for later how to work with Matthew right here in
Massachusetts schools we made I'll electronic books
so that Matthew could in fact move through them using his chins which
and in fact that the books talk themselves allowed so that even though
he was in a great decoder he could learn to code while a misreading
and so on but the main thing was it came out as a commercially extremely
successful product from Scholastic
not sold as a special needs product sold as a regular mainstream product in fact
I can tell you because you're
the right kind of audience that scholastic didn't even say
it was a good special needs product for two years
because they were afraid it would marginalize the market and was a very
popular program. the ultimately sold about forty million dollars in fact I
can say I was in New York yesterday
and I for those who have yes we're going to pass now serb out-of-date supporting
your program
but they are completely redoing it because
it's still sells a million dollars a year and then realized my god there's
still a great products they gonna make the whole thing over again
for modern technology which the legal it will be universally designed again
somatic can easily use this you get all the regular books but you get them in a
digital version
so that kids like matthew and kids with all sorts of disabilities
can use the same book read the same materials but get the supports they need
while they're doing it
the key thing about it is it's a universal design it's not a special
needs product
it's a product for the core of the classroom but one that everybody can use
okay that simply me and the Rangers students that we need to address is very
broad
I Mathies here in the middle but students with a wide range
disabilities what I want to concentrate on for a moment
in this may be the science part that riches I'm
talking about but II think which over overstated my credentials here
but we're very interested a cast began
really and Children's Hospital where we were on neuropsychologist who looked at
learning problems
kids wofford who had problems in learning and their job was to
do the diagnostic work and we moved from doing that diagnostic work to
wanting to find better things to recommend was really the essential
beginning a cast
so our backgrounds are pretty much in that what's the neurology of learning
something to just do a little short digression on this one just take my time
doing okay I'm because we needed to understand
what are the learning problems Kidspace
that we need to me make better designs for some just gonna do a quick
little thing through some pet scans and MRI spore you and I hope
you won't find it I either too boring cuz you already know it or
to whatever on Sony that the powerful things about the new technologies
at this end are that we can see learning actually happened so what you see on
this slide
are it's what's called a PET scan and what it's doing is showing
the burning up glucose the hotter it looks the more glucose is being bird
and what happens is when our neurons fire they need
oxygen and glucose to be able to fire again just like your muscles to
so as neurons fire a lot they require a lot more took us a lot more oxygen and
mostly imaging devices that we use now
for capturing that's this is a picture showing a brain that hearing words
on the left and seeing words on the right
the brighter it looks that's where it's burning a lot of energy
this kind of ability to actually watch the brain operate
has radically changed our view
up a lot of things about learning and I just want to convey a few of those to
you
but the big point I'm gonna make is that what it is demonstrated very clearly
is that learning is not one thing there isn't one kind of learner
there's not one kind of learning and let me just give you a couple examples
there many different kinds of learning in the following slide
this shows four deferred language tasks
but look how differently the brain lights itself up
I sometimes talk about the brain forming a committee to learn things
and I know in schools is hard to think about well-functioning committee but if
you can picture
%uh strong committee the brain puts together a committee
not too soft ass but look up different these committees are
and all of these our language so it shows right away that it's not a good
idea to think about
children or language as if it's one thing language is actually a lot of
different things
and our brain approaches it as a lot of problems to solve
so the top left is just dealing words that what's that's what lights up gets
hot
listening to them a different area gets hot speaking
words different areas yet still light up
and if I ask you to generate a ver rather than anywhere you want
look up differently the bottom right lights up and this was a knock out to
the neuroscientists oh my god how different it is
when you're asked to say a for then to say anywhere you want
it turned out to be really use your brain quite differently to do that to
stay within the class for
so this began to explode the view that well
where being kinda to gross about learning
it's not one thing it's got all these parts just a little bit more
even with then what we think of as one task our brain doesn't
approach it as one thing so here is your brain listening to music
and you can see up here on that left one
what the pup this was the party bring that lights up when you're listening to
the melody
but very different parts your brain lights up in both sides your brain by
the way
when you're listening I said Soria said the front think the first one is the
Harmony
the second one is the melody and the third one
is the rhythm your brain actually parcels it out
it's sort of like sound color by technicolour & sound-bite job leon films
the brains as you know what you take care the rhythm over there you take care
the melody over there
you take care up the harmony over there
puts together a committee to solve the problems listening to just
this is just listening to peace I love music
why do I wanna show you this because in fact people can have disabilities
in one of these and not the others myself as my wife claims
have no rhythm but I in fact get Melanie pretty well okay any chip you have your
varying disabilities when you listen to music
but they're really different there isn't a music center in the brain you're not
be surprised that there's not a reading center that's not a language center
there are many different parts
so that variety of which are students have difficulties in strengths
is really much richer and more interesting that we used to take
here's in fact the parts of your brain used to request
all these are dots that Joe parts that light up in reading single words
and in fact you see that almost the part some all
over the brain light up when you're reading salata your brain has two go
together to me
and I want to caution you this is just reading a single word if I put up
paragraphs here
even more your brain lights up lotta parts you bring up the light up
to a read the part that we're most interested in here
is that learning looks really deferred
in different kids up there with me so far showing that learning
up different kinds is really different in the brain but learning
among different kids is really different and I haven't don't have time to go
through all of the various kinds have
students we have so I'm just gonna let this one stand for it
here's the distance but the difference between a dyslexic student
on the left and I normally don't like that word normal
got this at newsweek they don't know how to write a typically achieving
typically achieving student I'm
and you'll see that the brain lights up very differently in the typically
achieving student then in the dyslexic
in particular in the back part of the brain as you see there
three areas light up no serious typically are not lighting up in
students that have dyslexia
so they're actually reading with different parts of their brain
and that's another shocker that it's not
you notice that it's not that they're trying hard it's not that they're
burning less glucose
they're burning glucose in a different part huge burden the front part of the
brain
and almost nothing in the back part and we know what those areas do now and so
on. it's very interesting work
okay but really different
and your students aren't the same when they learn
as they get older lot two studies are just coming out the last two years
looking at here is I students who are reading
the emotion in a situation what's going on
this person angry for example and what happens is
if you're teenager your
brain is lighting up like on the left using this area low down in temporal
cortex as we call it but when you're an adult
you actually repeat the same thing the emotion with a very different part of
your brain
because your brain has matured it's grown in that part of the brain is not
maturity generation teenager
so I love you that are wondering how come my kids don't get it
you know how come they seem emotionally laid by all in all of those
you gotta remember they're doing the motions with a different part of their
brain
the part that you use as an adult isn't there yet
so they seem a little emotionally outta control
actually like you are when you drink or do other things if you do
I and I individuals also differ
with experience I'm not gon take time to go into this cuz I wanna move to some
other things
but this just shows that in fact as you become more
expert your brain lights up very differently than when you're a beginner
at the beginning you tend to burn a lot of glucose
cuz you having to learn a lot and it gets more and more toward the middle you
can see where it's practiced
you get to save energy it's like you're saving glucose
okay you don't need as much but when you're a beginner at any task
you have a tremendous Big Bird at the beginning you've got to actually change
the way your brain is organized
but here's the problem teaching
learning is not one thing but teaching of Aeneas
we give one book to all thirty students
okay the same kind of information presented in the same way for everybody
at the same time
yet the diversity among our students is gigantic
I I think us get this but it's a wonderful go to reading research
quarterly the recent issue
talks about re looking at reading disability
and realizing that and I'll read this quote we find it difficult to understand
why anyone would deem instructional math
methods effective in instances where they do not work
because the definition of dyslexia is that you can't read under effective
instruction
and they're sayin well how can you call instruction effective if you know it
doesn't work
with this definition effective instruction is I instruction that is it
so facto
not effective for children who are dyslexic
rather than fault the instruction this definition faults the child
so that's what we're after here and it's great to see reading research court
which is that top reading journal saying
maybe we're looking at this problem differently steady at labeling the child
as the child has a disability that's not their language but mine
maybe we ought to label the instruction as disabled in step
asl I'm going a single out books I could do the same for lectures
but i wanna talk about the three central disabilities we think a book says having
as instructional environments for your students
and mine first books are disabling who they can teach
I've shown you the slides and stuff to say
books work very well for some students and very poorly for others
Matthew can't use them for two reasons you can't hold 'em internet pages
and he's dyslexic and it's a tough thing for him to learn history science
geography out of those books
they don't work well across all the students fact a probably everybody here
has children and students per home books are not
a great learning instrument what's not right
is to keep labeling the kids as the problem
okay second books are disabled in
what they can teach successfully books
I there's a a book that's out come out just recently about
why print the gutenberg revolution
ruined the teaching of mathematics
and the argument is that math was taught better in the 16th century
that it is now because it was hands on it was
bath about real things and people were really taught math
and what ru into teaching up math was after gutenberg you have to only do the
math that could be explained well in words
and as for I hope you're all reading and that means only
worse for kids who are dyslexic for example cuz
yet to get math through your worst input channel okay
so they're not in fact books are not effective their disabled in teaching
math in teaching science in teaching lotsa subjects
they're pretty good at teaching novels but it's a limited range up things that
which books are really good at
and thirdly as learning technologies books have disabilities
in how they prepare our students for their future there's nobody in this room
that doesn't think
that are why range a powerful technologies is what our students are
going to be using
as they get their first jobs and yet our schools
are still the largely
a print medium in lecture medium and when we are not
using new media in our schools we are not preparing students for their future
every student students with disabilities included
now not bashing the schools for this
we don't in fact support enough taxes to provide the instructional technologies
that schools really needs
our faults too so what are our options
I'm typically we have a wide range and diversity in our classrooms the first
thing we think of as well let's get a dumbed down version of our books in some
way
for kids that are having trouble reading and
that's a horrible injustice for lots of reasons
and the alternative that I wanna proposes that we need to smarten our
books up
and i wanna talk about a little bit about how you do that mainly
we can use the great power of new technologies
to individualize instruction so that in fact that fits for a broader set of
students
and to provide more powerful instructional methodologies
and that's what universal sign for learning is about is how do we in fact
create
learning materials that everybody can see
can read can learn from
Bob what kinda I
let me show you a different kinda book
that's out commercially wanted show you through talk about 30 things that I
think are very promising for the future
so first I'm gonna start with the
by the way I should've brought Bridge to Terabithia
which is in the movies but we have that book
can't spell my name
we all have disabilities okay so I let me tell you what this is
I'm opening up a book called The Giver how many of the
you have middle school else cause you like a lot of people aged it's very 10
most popular books a sign across the country
I and what's clastic did was a
we brought prototypes worked for years here in Massachusetts to
figure out how do we make books that are going to be much more universally
designed
I and then we abroad again to scholastic who then bought the rights to
I Tuck Everlasting Bridge to Terabithia the
and give her up about a whole bunch that are really
all a the award-winning books the best up the
a box that Aston's re middle school and iPods and choosing middle schools kinda
in the middle of the range here there's
on and other things I can talk about later for elementary and high school
on but anyway to thinking leaders what do you get
you get same book I and I'm just opening up in the middle here
I saying but everybody's going to meeting the same book we want it
universal
were all studying the giver but what's different
but we can make it accessible in lots of ways for example
up and simple things you can do whatever you need larger
text we don't need a large print version which is often not large enough and so
on we can just say well how large do we need it
and we can make it the right size so we can make a really small you want
whatever
we have the flexibility not not not a big deal
what's a bigger flexibility
usually but the morning ritual in the family members told their dreams
Janice didn't contribute much he rarely dream time
sometimes you work with the feeling of fragments of loading asleep I'm
but he couldn't seem to grasp okay so if you're blind
the whole book to read itself allowed to you gorgeously you don't have to go and
do anything or buy anything special
shots in a beautiful boy she notes that has music you may wonder why is the
music there
well in fact as you know it fire stints with Aspergers for example the hardest
part is to get the affect up what's going on music is just another cute you
use it
by the way you use it in the movie theater if they turn the sound off in
the movie theater you don't know what's going on either you know it's really
happy or sad or its whatever
I so it's an emotional track and that there's a little emotional track in here
by the way can turn all these features on or off
they're not for everybody user measure Needham I
what about so what are some other barriers we typically by the way
I'm not gonna bother to show it but I can make that meeting go highlight each
word at a time so it's incredibly slow and it guides me a long as I'm reading
I can't go very fast if I'm ATT I i can.
hi habit Bnai
girls boy a second have been a boy's why second have all the text /b purple
me there's a million options I can have a good say I want this book to look like
me and to respond to me
I what about language gets some sometimes other words easy to find you
just click on the word
say what's that word if english isn't my first language give it to me and my real
language
et cetera some multiple representation both I
what the word is in language and drawing and so on I
these and other things are just to say let's get rid of the barriers
first I want to make sure you can see all the words and know what they are
but that's not real reading so
that's the background when I wanna show yes what's the powerful stuff here
the powerful stuff is that we want kids to become better readers to become
strategic strong readers
but a lotta kids don't have the opportunities to get much practice
teachers have rare time to work individually
so we needed to do is make the book individualize to the kid so it knows
where are you in your reading
and how can I support you so watch what happens i'm reading along I come to a
place like this and it says
this is a good place to stop and think about the story
now what's powerful about these
is this book knows who I am a member I signed in as David rose
so it knows at what level up support
I need to become an effective reader
so I'm starting as if I'm really struggling reader and
what its noses I'm working on one strategy
which is summarizing other strategies are built in the book predicting what's
ahead
asking good questions but just ratchet building but right now I'm on some
rising someone say oh my god I hate it sounds like school
but some rising is something the kids really need to learn how to do
so when I click on this 3 summaries come up
and it says choose the best summary
cousin knows you know what a lot of research has been done and just a kid
said middle students
disabled and non-disabled alike don't have a good idea of what a summary looks
like
and we asked them to start writing long before they have any ideas and a white
something of all in at although that middle school teachers know is here
if you ask a middle school teacher donder a student underlying important
parts and passes them knowing everything
I they don't know how to do a summary its heart so what this does is just
choose one
okay but supposing that still too hard I can just say I need some help
all choose a summary that doesn't spend too much time
talking about one detail some gonna be honest with you
huh students hardly ever click on that okay
and you know why cuz it seems to
teacher early what date do click on
is just me. and other students that are
built into the books that are like them and I can have Justin media but he'll
talk to you if you want I
but Justin is like you like your pal
and he says well here's how I would do it soon as he begins to choose the best
summary I did this
and later when you're really making your own some raised us to Los a
essentially would you like to see my homework and you know what
students out love to do that
and people sometimes say well geez what the kids just copy that me know the
teachers
can see this till the students all know that some but the thing is the student's
name models
in justin is a guy that does it pretty well so he doesn't think allow details
you here so I write a summary
and you wanna see mine break look at it so the kids it's gonna get plenty of
help and they can get actually some rubrics and things about making but some
rays right here
open that up we never see kids do that kids go and ask Justin
okay on what happens when I click
all I do is I chose one but the powerful thing is
and by the way I just want peace clear that we don't think
these are as good as teachers teachers are way better than this but these are
just better than
books when the teachers not nearby software are going okay
so what happens I click and it's not right
um then it gives me immediate feedback like a good mentor it says
well that's not a good summary because what
and we'll tell you it's not a good sign because it has too much detail doesn't
talk about the main thing which is there in China or whatever
so you get all media feedback and your answer save to not say what happens that
okay I'll and then when you get a good one it's a great that's a great summary
because like a good teacher says because it does this
say you're learning how to make a good summary I'm
what I want to show you though is that that's way too much help for some
students
be demeaning think you know like okay they no in general what it some we
should look like and so on
I'm so what happens let's say the same book
but is still say this is rich Roberson little bits
in a lil smarty pants there and sit in class and
when he reads at the same passage I comes that same place now could decide
to summarize
it doesn't were give him some race to choose
it says well here six points
that were in just what you read choose the four most important points below to
use
in a summary because the research showed
consistently the kids don't at know about that step
that there was a lot of points and I need to choose only the most important
ones
and teachers don't have time to work with them long enough to struggling
students to figure it out
so here again you know Jonas just don't come out and help I get all kinds a help
but essentially I now can try out is this one importance that one is
important
and I'll get feedback then when I've got four points it'll say great
now use dole's to write your summary
casing can use your door scaffolding were saying there's a step
that the kids aren't getting about choose selecting down a little bit
and when they've done that step then we say great now summarize
I just say one more level up support
now there's kid smarter than rich
I'm I hope you understand I'm being facetious here
not smarter but in a different place in there learning
I have notice what happened the book highlighted itself
I and when you come that same passage it says
look at the highlighted words in that text to help you identify
the key information and then summarize the passage
for the first time I now can write
but oMG I didn't help like a good teacher it says
you know what it's your first time we're still early at looking back at the texts
by yourself
sure to highlight some things for you look back there especially
and then and porn point it does have a rubric built right into the book
it says your teachers been talking about these four things is important
look back at your own some readjust wrote doesn't do these things
because we the research showed that kids don't evaluate their own work
we need kids to look at their own work and say you know what
I forgot to do this so this just has to make sure you've checked your work
okay I get the idea that probably too much
there's more levels goes up to the last level is
this a good time to stop and check your reading how do you think you're doing
but you're on your own for what kinda strategy and your we're not going to get
any more support but you're on your own
but we're building in a progression an apprenticeship
in summarizing from where essentially doing it for you with you just make it a
few choices
up through we're giving you a lot I help and finally
you're on your own you know how to make good some race now
all this work is safe by the way for the teacher
to look at and here's everything I do ever this might
a a my progress progress monitoring course important
I my progress in the book everything I clicked on what can help
what kind answers I gave also a teacher can quickly look at it and go wow
billion your summaries are getting really good now
do you think you can do it with less support to the kids say
yeah it's like i don't be the training wheels anymore I'm fine
okay built into the book but you get the idea
okay so can you get books like this year you can get a matching
at I'm not advertising them other up by several companies now scholastic
add to cart research prototypes made them into thinking readers which are now
available
Pearson is now got amp product which has the same thing
should get books like this on
and students are plying students have cut their disability students bob up
long Sep on escape over these cuz I'm a little laid up
sort of what are the main issues we deal with I'll
when we think about universal design for learning
but we think about the materials which is what I've shown you
I but in fact we need to be careful about the standards
and objectives that we use we can always make standards
in a way that in fact lotsa students can't
reach them so part of the Universal Design for Learning guidelines talk
about how do you make standards
that have enough ways to get there that everybody can succeed
week don't talk about dumbing down the standards
we like I standards and I hope you all like standards
well we don't want is lower standards for students with disabilities
what we want is more routes to success
is there a buncha ways to get to that standard if there's only one way to get
to that standard then by god we're gonna disable our students
when our standards are what's disabled K
curricular materials and tools the same thing we can make materials which are
not disabled
like I've been showing you teaching methods how the teachers teach have 18
teach they work together
and lastly and most importantly with them gas and set her up
and by the way massachusetts is ahead here I'm
how do we make our assessments so they universally designed
what is that me it means that their accurate
most assessments traditional printed assessments are not
accurate because they confound
students access to the test with their knowledge
that the test is meant to measure the classic example
article just out yesterday in fact about students
taking math tests and students who
I'm HAART everywhere for example are struggling readers are at dyslexics
have lowered scores on their math tests
because the test is really confounding in testing the reading
instead of their math now you can say what will that mean obviously we can do
the same thing for the math test that I just did here we can have the math test
read itself allowed and give the kids the right kind of support
not about the map we want to challenge the kid to do the math wanna make the
math hard
but we can't double up and say but you know what
you're gonna have to be a reader affects
in order for us to even know how your Mathis
because what happens is the scores for fifty percent lower
for students with dyslexia on the math test then if they read the items allowed
okay so we're not getting an accurate measure it gets mass course
alright I two minutes and I'll be finished
out what's promising about moving in these directions
first publishers are starting to do this I show you a scholastic product
fierceness the same
I think all other publishers well begin to do this
and you know why because you're gonna ask for it you gonna say don't send me
disabled curricula anymore
send me curricula that oliver students can use
on and their successful media producers have listed here that are also working
on how do we make books you can get books problem according to bind dyslexic
from
I book share and so on electronic books where we can get a lot more support
built in the MENA printed books
so there's promising developments in the commercial industry
a big thing that I'm hoping you know about but most people
don't know about um in the IDPA regulations that which talked about
another's
is up a fundamentally
changing law for students with disabilities
and it's called the National instructional materials accessibility
standard
and it went into effect december sixth and
lots have you don't know about it because it's not controversial
like teacher quality or something like that but it is big
and here's what nine miss dozen out a way to go to learn more about it
and massachusetts is already on board 9 this requires
publishers to provide at the same time they publish
a print version on electronic version up their textbook
big deal yeah go ahead and clap yes it's good the
so a lot so he'll know you've had everything redo remake
books scan them into all that kinda stuff starting December 6th every book
every text book published in the US must provide
a beautiful XML markup digital version I love that book
to a national repository and you can get
okay and its only available to students who have print disabilities
ask Tracy hall is going to talk later today and if you wanna know
up to some these controversies going to hurt I but the cut on the controversy is
how big a group is included in print disabilities blankets clearly count kids
with
CP like magic clearly count kids with organic based learning disabilities
clearly count
but what about all the others okay so
big issues on who counts for nine us but the main thing is and states must have
a mechanism by which they distribute these electronic versions
to the students who have print disabilities so kids
teachers don't have to waste their time remaking books and making another
version and xeroxing and making it bigger and all that crap
teacher should be teaching not remaking broken materials
okay the
and lastly
what's promising is this meeting that
who's gonna drive this change you need to make sure your school no los
about night miss you need to make sure your school is asking
are you are you asking for universally design materials
cuz the publishers are exquisitely sensitive
to requests we want to buy this kinda stuff
so what you need to do is make sure your on the curriculum adoption committees
students with special needs parents often aren't there there and working on
special education you need to be on the regular education adoption committees
and when you're when they purchase the history books you need to say
I'm sure hope and that's a universally designed history curriculum so my kid
can participate and they and you know what will happen the publishers say yes
of course we do that
we do that absolutely on
and I just want this the what you can do I had too much time to go into that but
I wanna just say I'll if you wanna
still make your own books you yourselves can go to the cast website an absolutely
free because the ok the Massachusetts Department education support us in doing
this
any work with teachers with boston's what cognitive disabilities over the
last few years i really wanna thank
the messages problem education we now have a free book builder
you can come to this website and make books that will
year students can use and you can even building and supports
and show you how to do it so those things I was shown in thinking reader
can be in your voice in your students Voice stance but their own text in their
own images
and make their own books completely free thank you to
Massachusetts and at thank you to all you but if you come
%ah if you come and make books
you'll be able to share them with your but other teachers
and with your other students and so on so they'll be a library a books that are
really accessible
on these are for much younger children mostly but I'm gonna make a book about
brain development and doing in this fashion
so there's things you can do mainly advocates say we want universal design
materials
and we're working on NCLB wanna get it in NCLB that
the material sitcom should come so of Houston's can use it
thank you very much the
